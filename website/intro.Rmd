# What is R?

* A statistical programming environment
    + based on 'S'
    + suited to high-level data analysis
* But offers much more than just statistics
* Open source and cross platform
* Extensive graphics capabilities
* Diverse range of add-on packages
* Active community of developers
* Thorough documentation

# Why R?

We can do lot of stuffs in R. Starting from statestical analysis to plotting graphs and figures, Writing technical documentation to making a website and lot more. Lets explore.

According to recent editorials, the reproducibility crisis is still on-going

# Getting started

R can be done/executed using command line, or a graphical user interface (GUI). On this course, we use the RStudio GUI. Lets download required files and install. 

1. Get latest version of R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
    + This will come will some base packages installed for general tasks.
    + We can also download additional required packages from CRAN for specific tasks, Currently `r length(XML:::readHTMLTable("http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_date.html")[[1]][[2]])` available packages as of `r date()`
2. Download RStudio from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
    

To launch RStudio, find the RStudio icon and click
